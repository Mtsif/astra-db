# ASTRA: Atlas of STress Response Activity  

[![Website](https://img.shields.io/badge/Website-astra--db.com-blue)](https://astra-db.com)  

**ASTRA** is a curated database for exploring genome-wide RNA expression alterations in human cell lines exposed to molecular stresses.  
It integrates transcriptomic datasets across **heat shock, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and DNA damage** conditions to support research in stress biology and transcriptional regulation.
